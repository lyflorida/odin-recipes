                <p>Facilitated by COVID-19 lockdown protocols, early 2020 saw the emergence of simple, trendy recipes that could be attempted by anyone in the comfort of their own home, regardless of skill level. One of such
                recipes is the ever so famous <em>sushi bake</em>. At the most basic level, a sushi bake is essentially a deconstructed spicy crab roll that's baked like a casserole. The dish is credited to Mimi Qui Reyes, a 
                Filipino celebrity nail artist who started baking sushi casseroles as early as 2015.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Just as how sushi comes in endless variations, you could easily customize a sushi bake to your liking. This recipe specifically calls for the use of 
                imitation crab, but it can be used in combination with or subsituted out for any protein of your choosing, like salmon or tuna. If you're craving for a different depth of flavor, sprinkle some panko and drizzle some eel sauce on top! The possibilities are endless.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenreit. Rinse rice thoroughly and cook according to package instructions. In the meantime, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a bowl and heat in a microwave
                            briefly until the sugar dissolves. Set aside.</li>
                        <li>In another bowl, combine the shredded crab, cream cheese, mayo, and sriracha until smooth. Set aside.</li>
                        <li>When the rice is cooked, transfer the batch to a large bowl. Allow it to cool and dry slightly before pouring in the vinegar mixture and mix together with a rice paddle.</li>
                        <li>Spread the prepared sushi rice into an oven safe baking dish and evenly sprinkle about half of the furikake flakes on top.</li>
                        <li>Top with the crab-mayo-cream cheese mixture and drizzle the casserole with more mayo and sriracha, to your liking. Spinkle the remaining furikake ontop.</li>
                        <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes or until the top just begins to brown and bubble and the casserole is warmed through.</li>
                        <li>Garnish with the topped green onions and serve with roasted seaweed, sliced cucumbers, and/or sliced avocados. Enjoy!</li>
