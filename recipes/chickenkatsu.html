            <p>
                Katsu curry is a popular Japanese dish consisting of a deep-fried cutlet served with a portion of rice and curry. Traditionally, the <em>katsu</em>, or cutlet, can be made using pork loin, chicken thigh, or chicken breast. I personally prefer to use
                boneless skinless chicken thighs as they're very juicy and forgiving if you end up overcooking them. You can easily prepare Japanese-style curry using sauce blocks from popular brands like Golden Curry and Vermont Curry, or make
                your own from scratch. Doctor up the curry with any vegetables of your choosing and experiment with seasonings to your liking. There's also an interesting piece of lore behind the creation of this dish, if you're curious. The dish is rumored to have originated
                from a restaurant in Ginza, Tokyo, in 1948. Shigeru Chiba, a Yomiuri Giants athlete, complained that it was too bothersome to eat curry and katsu separately, leading to the birth of the dish!

            <p>Here's how to make chicken katsu curry!</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a small bowl, mix the eggs, flour, salt, pepper, and garlic powder into a wet batter. In another bowl, pour in 2 cups of panko and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Dredge each chicken cutlet thoroughly in the mixture, ensuring that every surface is completely saturated.</li>
                    <li>One by one, transfer each dredged cutlet into the bowl containing the panko. Thoroughly coat and firmly pack the panko on both sides of the cutlet. Set aside for now and prepare your frying method of choice (air fry or deep fry, you choose!).</li>
                    <li>Preheat a large saucepan on medium-high heat, and add about 2 tbsp of cooking oil. Add the chopped onions, garlic, carrots, and potatos. Saute for about 7 minutes or until the onions become translucent.</li>
                    <li>Add 2 Golden Curry Sauce Mix blocks and a splash of water. Saute until the sauce blocks are somewhat dissolved. Add soy sauce and salt to taste.</li>
                    <li>Submerge the stir-fried vegetables in about 3 cups of water and throw in the remaining 2 sauce blocks. Allow the mixture to come to a boil and then place the saucepan lid back on the pan. Keep the heat on low to medium-low</li>
                    <li>Once your frying method is ready, cook the cutlets until they reach an internal tempearture of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. By the time you finish frying, the curry should be cooked. Check the doneness of the vegetables by piercing with a fork.</li>
                    <li>Slice up the cutlets to your liking and ladle some hot curry on top. Eat with a side of rice or with udon noodles. Enjoy!</li>
