                <p>When I tell you this recipe is extremely simple to make, I'm not kidding. It's no surprise that fried rice is a staple meal amongst college students, as it is a breeze to prepare and
                relatively low-cost for anyone on a budget. Fried rice is a dish of cooked rice that has been stir-fried with other ingredients such as eggs, vegetables, seafood, or meat. As a homemade
                dish, fried rice is typically made with ingredients left over from other dishes, leading to the emergence of countless variations.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>The Korean version of fried rice is called <em><strong>bokkeum-bap</strong></em>,
                and the one showcased here is a popular variety prepared with kimchi, called <em><strong>kimchi bokkeum-bap</strong></em>. Kimchi fried rice is my personal favorite because it has such a unique and complex 
                flavor profile that is easy to achieve and hard to mess up. Throw whatever ingredients and seasonings your heart desires into the wok along with some rice and soy sauce, and start stir frying!</p>
